This script simply calls the neccesary programs
regarding specific task during the development
of STM32 projects that make use of Makefiles
generated with STM32CubeMX.

It (hopefully) saves some keystrokes and mental pain.

Following programs are required to be included in `$PATH`:

* make
* [arm-none-eabi-\*](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) binaries
* [texane/stlink](https://github.com/texane/stlink) binaries (`st-flash`,
`st-util`, `st-info`)

# installation

    git clone https://github.com/adzierzanowski/mkstm32.git
    pip3 install mkstm32

# Windows things

I tried to make this script as platform independent as I could.
All of the required software is available for Windows.
You should be able to run this script after:

* installing python3
* making sure you have added all the neccessary programs to `PATH`
* making sure all of those programs are named properly (e.g. if you're
using mingw32, you should use `make.exe` from `MinGW\msys\1.0\bin` rather
than `mingw32-make.exe` from `MinGW\bin` or rename `mingw32-make.exe` to `make.exe`).

If you are using `cmd.exe`, I recommend using [ansicon](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon)
for colorful messages. It's way easier to skim through the output.

# usage

    usage: mkstm32 [-h] [-u] [-d] [-v V] [-c] [-p DIR] [-s] [-x] [-z] [-i] [-m]
               [-P PORT] [-r]

    Upload, debug and compile STM32CubeMX Makefile projects

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    Common operations:
    -u, --upload
    -d, --debug           Start GDB session
    -v V, --verbosity V   Verbosity level from -1 (completely silent) to 2
                            (fully verbose, default)

    Project operations:
    -c, --compile         Call make with appropriate Makefile
    -p DIR, --project-dir DIR
                            Defaults to current dir
    -s, --size            Print size of built binaries
    -x, --cpp             Use C++ rather than C
    -z, --clean           Clean (remove) build directory

    ST-Link operations:
    -i, --probe           Print ST-Link connection information
    -m, --monitor         Serial monitor
    -P PORT, --port PORT
    -r, --reset           Reset the microcontroller

# examples

Say we want to compile, upload and debug a project in directory `F042_test`.

    mkstm32 -zxcudp F042_Test

* `-z` switch removes build directory.
* `-x` is a flag that tells the script to convert Cube Makefile to C++ Makefile.
* `-c` stands for compile.
* `-u` uploads compiled project to the microcontroller.
* `-d` starts a GDB debugging session after compilation and upload.
* `-p` specifies the project directory.

Et voil√†.

# TODO

When uploading and there's more than one serial port, user should be able to choose one.
